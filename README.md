Assume the CPI index 𝐼𝑡 follows a log‐normal model (geometric Brownian motion), i.e.,
𝑑𝐼𝑡
𝐼𝑡
= 𝜇𝑑𝑡 + 𝜎𝑑𝑊𝑡
,
where 𝑊𝑡
is a Wiener process, 𝜇 the constant drift, and 𝜎 > 0 is the diffusion coefficient with
estimates 𝜇̂= 0.05321 and 𝜎̂ = 0.06358. Assume there is no inflation indexation lag.
Assume that the issuers yield curve on the valuation date is given by the Nelson–Siegel-Svensson
zero-coupon rate function parameters,
